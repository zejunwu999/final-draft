			<h2>VR experience for neuroscience education</h2>
		</div>

		<div>
		<h2>Problem</h2>
		<p>Neuroscience is a subject interesting to explore and important to the studies of 
			many other fields as well. However, the beginning of neuroscience study can be 
			somewhat hard. Unlike subjects such as math or computer science, students see 
			algebra, shapes, or codes exactly as they are on textbooks or desktop screens. 
			The neuroscience theories can be abstract and difficult to understand, especially 
			for starters, because people cannot see what takes place in the brain.</p>

		</div>

		<div>
		<h2>Solution: VR experience for neuroscience education</h2>
		<p>The reason why I choose VR to solve the problem: neuroscience can be hard, abstract, 
			and not appealing because people cannot see what takes place in the brain. What is 
			different from other VR products with the topic of brain/neuron trips: I will pay 
			more attention to the journey process for education, and try to create more chances 
			for interactions to let users be more engaged.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
		<h2>Key Interactions</h2>
		<p>Travel  in the brain. Users take a “brainship” in my VR story. They are able to use 
			the left controllers to control the direction and the speed when moving through the 
			neurons. This enables users to have an immersive and fun experience when learning 
			neuroscience. Voice instructions, which play a significant role in the education 
			part, are played through the whole journey. <br><br>
		</p>
		
		<p>Shoot with laser gun. Users can use the right handle to control the laser gun to 
			shoot the neuron. The neuron will be activated. I use self-luminous function to 
			change the light and color of the neuron to show the activation status, and the 
			neuron’s activation will stimulate other neurons to be activated.<br><br></p>
		
		<p>Drive close to see the transmission process. If users drive close to the neurons,
			 they can see the neurotransmitter transmitted between neurons. This interaction
			  is supposed to help users better understand the transmission process, and make 
			  the VR story more impressive.</p>
