		<h2>Website event portal design for Chadsey-Condon Community Organization</h2>
		</div>

		<div>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>Chadsey-Condon Community Organization (CCCO) is a Detroit, Michigan-based non-profit organization. 
		CCCO hosts events around neighborhoods and interacts with residents in their areas to build a better 
		community. The current event information presentation is not integrated and the event organization 
		process at CCCO is time-consuming. Internal stakeholders, residents, and external partners are 
		having difficulty obtaining all previous and upcoming event information in one place.</p>

		</div>

		<div>
		<h2>Solution: An event portal on the current website</h2>
		<p>With the project scope and our client vision, we designed an event portal on their current 
			website to help the community improve the event-related information display and event sign-up 
			process as well as to strengthen the relationships with residents and partners.</p>
		</div>

		<img class="prototype" src = "images/ccco-past-event.png" alt="The past event page design prototype on the website."/>
		</div>

		<h2>Design Process</h2>
		<p>We started our projects with research, including background research, competitive analysis, 
			and stakeholders interviews. We synthesized our findings through affinity diagrams, and then 
			moved on to personas and journey maps to map out the main user groups and the user journey. 
			After bring out the how-might-we question, we started brainstroming and came up with a few 
			versions of wireframes. We did testing and iterated till the final design.</p>
